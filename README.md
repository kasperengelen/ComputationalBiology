# Project Introduction to Computational Biology

## Overview

Project for the course Introduction to Computational Biology at the University of Antwerp, 2018-2019. In this project we built compartmental models (SEIRZ, SEISZ) for the spread of a disease inside a population of amphibians. Afterwards we evaluated a number of mitigation measures using the previously built models. This was documented in a [paper](../main/COMPBIO19_proposal_KaLoWi.pdf).
